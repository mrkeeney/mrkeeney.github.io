  <h1>Rotamer Optimization</h1>
	<p>The Rotamer Optimization algorithm available in Force Field X uses dead-end elimination to search through rotamers, or common discrete amino acid side chain conformations, in order to find an energetically favorable conformation. The video below demonstrates a rotamer search through the ACTG1 protein.</p>

  <h1>Missense Variation Simulation</h1>
        <p>Molecular biophysics software tools can be used to calculate the free energy change of missense mutations using dual topology where atoms are slowly phased in and out of the free energy calculation. As the atoms in the wild type amino acid become less prominent in the calculation, atoms in the genetic variant become more prominent, shown in the video below. The slow phasing of atoms from the wild type and variant amino acids prevents the atoms of the variant from interacting (as would not be expected in vivo) with wild type atoms and vice versa. In addition to the dual topology approach, molecular dynamics occur simultaneously. The video shows an alchemical transition from arginine to tryptophan. </p>
