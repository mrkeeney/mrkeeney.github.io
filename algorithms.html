  <h1>Rotamer Optimization</h1>
	<p>The Rotamer Optimization algorithm available in Force Field X uses dead-end elimination to search through rotamers, or common discrete amino acid side chain conformations, in order to find an energetically favorable conformation. The video below demonstrates a rotamer search through the ACTG1 protein.</p>

  <h1>Missense Variation Simulation</h1>
        <p>Molecular biophysics software tools can  calculate the free energy change of missense mutations using a dual topology approach where atoms are  slowly phased in and out of the free energy calculation. As the atoms in the wild type amino acid become less prominent in the calculation, atoms in the genetic variant become more prominent, shown in the video below. The slow phasing of atoms from the wild type and variant amino acids prevents the atoms of the variant from interacting (as would not be expected in vivo) with wild type atoms and vice versa. The video shows an alchemical transition from arginine to tryptophan. </p>

  <h1>Molecular Dynamics</h1>
	<p>In addition to the dual topology phasing of atoms, molecular dynamics occurs simultaneously in a free energy calculation. The video below shows the same arginine to tryptophan transition as before with additional molecular dynamic changes.</p>
